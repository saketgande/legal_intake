/**
 * Server-only Auth0 wiring.
 *
 * Two modes, decided at runtime by checking AUTH0_SECRET:
 *
 *   1. Configured  — AUTH0_SECRET + AUTH0_BASE_URL + AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL
 *                    + AUTH0_CLIENT_ID + AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET all set.
 *                    Real auth flow: handleAuth() routes login/logout/
 *                    callback/me; getResolvedSession reads the encrypted
 *                    cookie + upserts a User row keyed by email.
 *
 *   2. Disabled   — any required env var missing.
 *                    Local-dev mode: the demo runs as the seeded
 *                    admin (Alex Nguyen) with no login flow. Useful
 *                    for `pnpm dev` against a fresh sandbox where
 *                    setting up an Auth0 tenant is overkill.
 *
 * The mode flips silently — nothing crashes when keys are absent. The
 * route protection middleware in apps/web checks isAuth0Configured()
 * and short-circuits to "let everyone in as the demo admin" when off.
 *
 * The seed admin in Step 2 has every Permission. Step 3's seeded
 * test users let local dev preview the demo as different roles by
 * editing the .env.local override (DEV_USER_EMAIL).

 * the moment `NODE_ENV=production` AND `AUTH0_SECRET` is unset. Vercel
 * sets `NODE_ENV=production` for both Production and Preview deploys,
