# AEGIS — Intake-only client install

This guide deploys AEGIS for a client who licenses **Legal Intake only**.

## What "Intake-only" means here

AEGIS is one application (`apps/web`, a Next.js app) over one Postgres
database. You do **not** ship a carved-out "intake module" — you deploy
the whole app with the **intake navigation profile** so the client sees
only Intake. The rest of the platform keeps running underneath, which is
what gives Intake its full capability:

- All 6 agents (NDA, Vendor/OFAC, Trademark, Contract Review, FAQ, Policy)
- Document upload (`.docx` / `.txt` / `.pdf`) feeding the agents
- Email channel: inbound webhook **and** real Microsoft 365 mailbox polling
- **Server-side triage** — emailed/polled tickets are triaged on arrival
- Smart routing, SLA dashboard, Self-Service KB
- Ticket → **Matter auto-spawn** on approval (the "one brain" payoff)
- Chain-sealed `AuditLog` evidence

The client just doesn't see the other module tabs.

## 1. Turn on the profile

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AEGIS_PROFILE=intake
```

The side-nav then shows **Legal Intake** + **Users / Roles / Audit Log**
(each still permission-gated). Every other module is hidden, and stale
`?view=` deep links to hidden modules fall back to Intake.

## 2. Environment

| Var | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Postgres (Neon or self-hosted). |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ✅ for real agents | Without it, agents fall back to the deterministic classifier. |
| `AUTH0_SECRET`, `AUTH0_BASE_URL`, `AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✅ for prod | Real login + RBAC. Without them, dev-mode resolves everyone to the seeded admin — **never deploy to a client without these.** |
| `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SEED_ADMIN_NAME` | ✅ for prod | The real admin's Auth0 email + display name (see CLAUDE.md). |
| `AEGIS_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | ✅ for the email webhook | Constant-time auth; the webhook is **fail-closed in production** (503 if unset) and rate-limited (60/min/IP). |
| `AEGIS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | ✅ when using M365 | 32-byte key (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Seals M365 secrets with AES-256-GCM. In production a missing key fails loud instead of storing plaintext. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AEGIS_PROFILE=intake` | ✅ | Intake-only nav. |
| M365 delegated service account | ✅ for this client (email polling) | See `docs/m365-ediscovery-onboarding.md`. |

## 3. Install, migrate, seed, run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @aegis/db exec prisma migrate deploy   # applies all migrations

# Clean PRODUCTION seed — org + admin (from SEED_ADMIN_*) + the 8 roles +
# matter-type configs + OFAC sanctions list. NO demo tickets/personas.
# (PowerShell: $env:AEGIS_SEED_PROFILE="production"; then run the seed.)
AEGIS_SEED_PROFILE=production pnpm --filter @aegis/db run db:seed

pnpm build
pnpm --filter @aegis/web start                        # or deploy apps/web to Vercel
```

> The default `db:seed` (without `AEGIS_SEED_PROFILE=production`) loads the
> **demo** dataset — use it for your own demo env, never for a client.

For Vercel: set all the env vars above on the project, point it at
`apps/web`, and connect the Neon database.

## 4. Email channel (optional, gives Intake its full reach)

- **Webhook (no M365 needed):** `POST /api/intake/email-webhook` with the
  secret header. Demoable with `curl`.
- **Real M365 polling (P4b):** connect the delegated service account at
  `/admin/m365` (re-authorize so it picks up `Mail.Read` + `Mail.Send`),
  add a mailbox via `POST /api/admin/intake/mailboxes`, and schedule
  `POST /api/admin/intake/mailboxes/poll` (Vercel Cron / GitHub Actions).
  Set `autoAckEnabled` on the mailbox for threaded auto-replies.

## 5. Production gate — status

Done and in place:
- **Server-side triage** — emailed/polled tickets are triaged on arrival.
- **Webhook**: fail-closed auth (constant-time), idempotent ingest
  (dedupe), and rate limiting (60/min/IP).
- **Secrets at rest**: set `AEGIS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and M365 secrets are
  AES-256-GCM encrypted; production fails loud without it.
- **Clean production seed** (no demo data).

Still open (single-client deployments get their own DB, so lower urgency):
- **Tenancy isolation / row-scoping** for a future multi-tenant host.
- **Observability** (error tracking / structured logs) — pick a provider.

## Why not extract Intake into its own repo?

Because it would **remove** capability: M365 email polling and
ticket→matter auto-spawn both reuse the shared `@aegis/matter` Graph +
matter services, and the agents/audit chain live in shared packages. A
standalone fork drops those features and permanently diverges from
`main`. The profile flag gives the client a clean Intake-only experience
with none of that loss.
