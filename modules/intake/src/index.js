/**
 * @aegis/intake — Legal Intake module (bulk-moved in Step 1).
 *
 * Step 1 ships this as a single mass: every export the v8 demo needed,
 * surfaced from one entry point. Step 5 (PR #5) splits this into a proper
 * api.ts (public) + internal/ (private) layout. Until then, callers use
 * the named exports below; the surface will narrow in Step 5.
 *
 * apps/web is the composition root and may import anything from here. Other
 * modules (Matter, Spend, …) MUST go through this package's eventual api.ts
 * — and in Step 1, since api.ts does not exist yet, no other module imports
 * from @aegis/intake. ESLint will enforce that once a second module exists.
