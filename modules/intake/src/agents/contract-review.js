const CONTRACT_PLAYBOOK=`AEGIS Contract Playbook (defaults to check against):
- Limitation of liability: cap = 12 months' fees; uncapped carve-outs for IP infringement, confidentiality breach, indemnity, gross negligence/willful misconduct. Reject unlimited liability or no cap.
- Indemnification: mutual, third-party claims only. Reject unlimited or first-party indemnities.
- Governing law: Delaware preferred; NY/CA acceptable. Avoid counterparty's home jurisdiction for non-US.
- Payment: Net 45 (Net 30 only with ≥2% prompt-pay discount).
- Auto-renewal: acceptable only if non-renewal notice ≤60 days AND uplift capped.
- Termination for convenience: we want 30 days' notice. Pure term-lock with no exit = flag.
- Price increases: capped at lesser of 5% or CPI.
- Assignment: no assignment without consent (affiliate/M&A successor OK); termination right on change of control to a competitor.
- Warranty/acceptance: 90-day warranty + 30-day acceptance. Avoid AS-IS for paid deliverables.
- IP: present-tense assignment of deliverables; license-back for background IP.`;

${CONTRACT_PLAYBOOK}

TICKET:
- Requester: ${ticket.from} (${ticket.dept})
- Description: "${ticket.desc}"

Produce a first-pass review that:
1. Identifies which key clauses are mentioned and how they compare to the playbook.
2. Flags each DEVIATION with a severity: BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
3. Notes what still needs the full document to assess.
4. Gives a recommendation (e.g. "negotiate the liability cap and governing law before signing").

This is a first pass — it always requires attorney sign-off before execution. Set confidence to reflect how much you could assess from the description.
