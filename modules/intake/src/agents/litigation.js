TICKET:
- Requester: ${ticket.from} (${ticket.dept})

Extract and assess:
1. Adverse party / counterparty (name if stated).
2. Nature of the claim (contract, IP, employment, regulatory, other).
3. Jurisdiction / forum if stated.
4. Any deadline (response/answer date, statutory deadline) — flag if time-sensitive.
5. Apparent severity (routine / elevated / critical).
6. Recommended handling tier: junior review, or escalate to senior litigation counsel.
